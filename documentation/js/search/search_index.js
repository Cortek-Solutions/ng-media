You can manage dependencies using this gallery, for file uploads and file select. Avoid uploading files for users, posts or other entities.\nYou can use the API set for this front-end module. When a user uploads image, they can crop and edit it.\n\nInstalling and usage\nYou can simply install this package on your Angular 2, Angular 4 and Angular 5 project:\nnpm install ng-media@latestthen, you need to add it into your module:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgMediaModule } from 'ng-media'; // this line you need\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    NgMediaModule // this line you need\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Then you can use it's component inside your application, for example update your app.component.html:\nFor parameters and attributes, please review the README.\nUsing as a gallery selector\nWhen user uploads images, you probably expect that they can select and assign to something, you need to open this dialog programmitically. For this purpose, open the public service.\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgMediaModule, NgMediaService } from 'ng-media'; // this line you need\n\n@Component({\n  selector:
